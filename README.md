# Projektstudium
This is a repository for testing for  a university project


The scripts are customized and were inspired by multiple creators.


schnap.ps1 is a fully functional powershell script, that grabs all files from a directory, compresses them into a .zip folder, uploads them to a Dropbox and deltes all traces afterwards. The generated access toekn for the Dropbox App has to be genereated after 4h. Right now there is a error indicating that there is something wrong with the acess token for DropBox. I will look into it.
